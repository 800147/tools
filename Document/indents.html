      <h1>Document.css indents</h1>

      <h2>Where is the gap?</h2>
      <p>
        Styling text document is mostly about fonts and indents. Sounds pretty simple but this
        little complexity is enough for having problems. The main difficulty is that the indent
        specified by margin CSS property is the indent between text lines that already contain
        font-specific gaps. And those who will read the document will not be able to recognise this
        indent because there aro no visual designation of line-height but what is recognisable is
        the indent between baseline of text above and meanline of text below.

          b) the indent that person can recognise
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        So I desided to indent the text by those visual lines in Document.css and for the same
        reason the better way of sizing the font is to specify the x-size, not the font-size.
      </p>

      <h2>What is the grid?</h2>
      <p>
        Choosing the size of font or size of indent is always the torment especially for
        non-designer developers like me. Should this header be the size of 20px or 24px? It always
        hard to deside. Fortunately, same problem has been successfully solved for the tasks
        estimating in Agile — using Fibonacci sequence in estimates. Choosing between 21 and 34 is
        easier than choosing between 20 and 24. And to make things even easier, I desided to use not
        the Fibonacci sequence but golden ratio sequence. They are very similar but golden ratio
        makes every next value to be higher than the previous by the same ratio (x1.618) and it
        easier to calculete.

      <figure>
        <img src="images/sizes.png" width="520" height="110" />
        <figcaption>the sizes are belong to the golden ratio sequence</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        So both indent system and size grid are results in next picture:
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/indents.png" width="520" height="380" />
        <figcaption>every size and indent in document follows the size grid</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h2>Sizes composition</h2>
      <p>
        Golden ratio sequence as well as the Fibonacci sequence follows the rule that the next value
        is a sum of two previous. This allows to combine sizes in different ways.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/composition.png" width="520" height="185" />
        <figcaption>some sizes combinations</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        You can see the benefits of this combinations on the next picture. Breadcrumbs height and
        indents in sum are the same height as the indent between the top of the document and header.
        So no matter if there are breadcrumbs, document header is always in same place and in all
        cases all sizes and indents are follow common rules.
